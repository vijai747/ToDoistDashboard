    "I use the popular ToDoist application to track all of my open tasks. ToDoist has many strengths - e.x. a clean user interface, presence on every platform, and gamification features (ToDoist Karma). One of its main flaws, however, is the omission of useful tools that could be used to track productivity.\n",

    "The purpose of this analysis is to use the ToDoist API to derive insights about how to improve my productivity. Some of the questions investigated are the following: \n",

    "- How many tasks were completed on a weekly basis?\n",
    "- What is the breakdown of completed tasks by required energy level?\n",
    "- Is there a correlation between number of total tasks completed and required energy level?\n",

    "This project was quite helpful in understanding some basic facts about my productivity history:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall, I learned that the end of June and early August were my most productive months (when I had quite a few parallel projects due)\n",
    "- There is a positive correlation between the number of high-level energy tasks completed and total tasks. Getting the hard tasks accomplished may motivate me to complete more of the easier tasks.\n",
    "- I've spent a significant portion of my time (over 150+ hours) in meetings and making shipments. I need to have a discussion about these two topics with manager to see how we can reduce the amount of time spent on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completing this analyis only leads to more questions, however. In a future revision to this project, I would be curious to explore the following:\n",
    "- How did the number of meetings in a week affect the total number of high-energy tasks completed?\n",
    "- Why exactly was I able to complete more high-energy tasks in certain weeks as opposed to others? Could the number of my social engagements with friends have had an impact?\n",
    "- Was I able to complete high-energy tasks during the week or on the weekend?\n"
